Java GUI, randomly generated cave system using Cellular Automata (...sort of)
Currently, the UI is setup to only function on a 1920x1080 fullscreen system. 
This will get changed later on, but for now it will likely malfunction on smaller screens.
Map.java is the runner file

Player movement functions with the arrow keys. 
Currently, 9 tiles are available to move through. a 3x3 grid.

AI pathfinding is currently implemented. AI follows the player around if it player steps within some sight range. Think it is set to around 5 tiles.
Attack system and health will be added next update.
Not working on this much right now.
